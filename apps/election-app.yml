    This application labels Reddit posts using two categories:
      
      - Factual  
      - Bias towards a candidate  
       
    The goal of this application is to allow categorization of headlines by topic, factuality and potential bias towards a candidate. Generally, as
    the factual score of articles increases, the level of bias should decrease. 
      
    Data is pulled via the Reddit API using a series of queries for link posts. In most but not all cases, the titles of these posts are
    headlines for articles.
      
    The application is backed by a zero-shot classifier, which is a classifer that uses a large general language model without training data.
